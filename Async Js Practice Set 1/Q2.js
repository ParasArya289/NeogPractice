// Write a function ‘delayedAddition’ that takes in two numbers and consoles their sum after a delay of 4 seconds using setTimeout. You can practice this question in any JS editor or your browser console.

const delayedAddition = (a, b) => setTimeout(() => console.log(a + b), 1000);

const res = delayedAddition(2, 3);
//5
